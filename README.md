# Introduction to Alignment with TopHat 

[TopHat](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml) is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads that uses [Bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) underneath the hood to perform memory-efficient short read alignments. Though it has been somewhat superseded by [HISAT2](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) (developed by the same group - the [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University), it is still a vital component in many different sequence analysis pipelines and thus plays an important role in the bioinformatics toolkit. 

## How it Works
